# Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow, coding standards, and processes for the Order Management System project.

## Development Environment Setup

Follow the instructions in the main README.md file to set up your development environment.

## Git Workflow

We follow a Git flow branching model:

1. `main` branch: Production-ready code
2. `develop` branch: Integration branch for features
3. Feature branches: Created from `develop` for new features
4. Hotfix branches: Created from `main` for critical fixes

### Branch Naming Convention

- Feature branches: `feature/<feature-name>`
- Bug fix branches: `bugfix/<bug-name>`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/<fix-name>`
- Release branches: `release/<version>`

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch from `develop` (for features/bugs) or `main` (for hotfixes)
2. Implement your changes with appropriate tests
3. Push your branch to GitHub
4. Create a pull request against the original branch
5. Wait for review and CI/CD pipeline to pass
6. Address any feedback
7. Merge once approved

## Code Standards

### General Guidelines

- Write self-documenting code with clear function/variable names
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comments for complex logic, but prefer readable code

### Frontend Standards

- Follow the ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow Component-Driven Development approach
- Keep components small and focused
- Use CSS-in-JS or Tailwind for styling
- Implement proper prop validation
- Use React hooks for state management
- Implement error boundaries for resilience

### Backend Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type annotations
- Organize code into logical modules
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Implement proper validation for all inputs
- Document all APIs with docstrings

## Testing Guidelines

### Frontend Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Create component tests with React Testing Library
- Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details
- Aim for 80%+ test coverage for critical code paths
- Run tests before pushing: `npm test`

### Backend Testing

- Write unit tests for isolated functionality
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock external dependencies
- Implement test database for integration tests
- Aim for 80%+ test coverage
- Run tests before pushing: `pytest`

### End-to-End Testing

- Implement critical user journey tests
- Test key functionality end-to-end
- Run E2E tests before major releases
- Run tests: `cd e2e && npm test`

## Code Review Guidelines

### What to Look For

- Code correctness and logic
- Test coverage and quality
- Performance considerations
- Security implications
- Documentation
- Adherence to code standards
- Potential edge cases

### Review Process

1. Reviewer examines the changes
2. Provides specific, actionable feedback
3. Suggests improvements
4. Approves or requests changes
5. Author addresses feedback or discusses alternatives
6. Process repeats until approved

## Continuous Integration

The CI pipeline runs the following checks:

1. Linting
2. Type checking
3. Unit tests
4. Integration tests
5. Build process

All checks must pass before merging PRs.

## Deployment

### Environments

1. Development: Local environment for developers
2. Staging: Pre-production environment for testing
3. Production: Live environment

### Deployment Process

1. Merge to `develop` triggers deployment to staging
2. Create a release branch for production releases
3. Merge to `main` triggers deployment to production
4. Monitor deployment for any issues
5. Rollback if necessary

## Documentation

- Update documentation when adding/changing features
- Document APIs using JSDoc (frontend) or docstrings (backend)
- Keep README.md up to date
- Create/update user documentation as needed

## Version Control Practices

- Commit frequently with meaningful commit messages
- Follow conventional commits format
- Rebase feature branches before merging
- Squash commits when appropriate
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize database queries
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Minimize API calls
- Optimize frontend rendering
- Implement lazy loading for large resources

## Security Best Practices

- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize outputs to prevent XSS
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use environment variables for sensitive values
- Implement rate limiting
- Use HTTPS for all communications
