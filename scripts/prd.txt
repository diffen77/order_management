- **Challenge**: Real-time inventory updates across multiple sessions
  **Mitigation**: Use WebSockets or similar technology for live data synchronization

### Resource Constraints
- **Challenge**: Limited development resources for all planned features
  **Mitigation**: Prioritize core functionality for MVP, then add features incrementally

- **Challenge**: Maintaining code quality with rapid development
  **Mitigation**: Implement automated testing, code reviews, and clear documentation
